SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

SQL is a programming language used to manage and manipulate databases by querying, updating, and organizing data.

The "Injection"

Means attackers insert (or "inject") malicious code or commands into an application’s input fields or data channels to trick the system into executing unintended actions.

Why Is SQL Injection So Dangerous?

• Data theft: Attackers can read sensitive records (PII, credentials, cards).
  
• Data manipulation: They can modify or delete data, corrupting integrity.
  
• Authentication bypass: Logins and access checks can be defeated.
  
• Privilege escalation: Attackers can gain higher DB or system privileges.
  
• Full system compromise: From the DB they can run commands or pivot to internal networks.
